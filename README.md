# Ember-resource-card

An addon which allows you to search for an entity using a typeahead, display the details of that entity once it's been selected. Edit it in place, and add a new one. Very much a WIP. Use at your own risk. 

## Installation

* `git clone` this repository
* `npm install`
* `bower install`




//TODO
1. Implement option for using ember-changeset. https://github.com/DockYard/ember-changeset
